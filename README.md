# Dino Run Game - Final Project README

## Overview
This project is a clone of the popular Dino Run game that appears when Chrome is offline. It was developed as a final project for Computer Science 2 by Enerelt Enkhtur and Mukhammadyusuf Abdurakhimov.

The game is simple but challenging, where the player controls a dinosaur running across the desert, avoiding obstacles like cacti and birds by jumping or ducking. The game continues endlessly, with the goal of surviving as long as possible and achieving a high score.

## Features
- **Infinite Runner:** The game continues endlessly until the player collides with an obstacle.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The dinosaur can jump over cacti and duck under flying birds.
- **Score System:** The longer the dinosaur survives, the higher the score.
- **Increasing Difficulty:** As the game progresses, the speed of the dinosaur and the number of obstacles increase.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game:** The game starts when the player presses the spacebar or taps the screen (for mobile versions).
2. **Jump:** Press the spacebar or tap to make the dinosaur jump over obstacles.
3. **Duck:** Press the down arrow to make the dinosaur duck under obstacles like birds.
4. **Game Over:** If the dinosaur hits an obstacle, the game ends. You can restart by pressing space again.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/dino-run.git
   ```
2. **Run the Game:** Open the game in your preferred code editor or IDE. To run the game, simply execute the main script (`dino_run.py` or equivalent, depending on the language used).

## Project Structure
- **main.py:** The main game loop and logic.
- **dino.py:** Class controlling the dinosaur's movements and actions.
- **obstacle.py:** Manages the different obstacles that appear during gameplay.
- **assets/:** Contains all the image files (sprites) and sounds used in the game.

## Future Improvements
- **Mobile Compatibility:** Add touch controls for better mobile experience.
- **New Obstacles:** Introduce different types of obstacles and power-ups.
- **High Score Feature:** Save and display the player's highest score.
